      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Flordia State Forest Service has a program that if you hike a certain amount of trails in Florida, you receive a badge, to encourage the use of the trails. And if you continue to hike more trails, more badges to show your accomplishment. But the process of receiving these badges is rather convoluted involving the need to gather postcards at each trail that may or may not be there. So I am designing a website that makes the record-keeping of which trails people have hiked easy. Instead of gathering and mailing postcards, I have a website that records all the QR codes that will be posted at all of these trails. Once a person has a high enough count of QR codes, along with confirmation of their GPS locations, they will receive their badge. A system that was complicated and tedious, is now a scan away from your phone.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People who love to hike the trails of Florida. Paticularly thoughs who either are hiking lovers who want to have some record of their journeys or those who want some information so that they can get started. Whether they be rich or poor is not a focus neither is if they are young or old. Our focus group are those who love the outdoors. It is also for those who want a better and easier way to record their trail progess.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        The main purpose of this website is to help people on their Florida hiking trips and enjoy the memory of it. This website will have the main page along with two child pages to answer some of the questions that Floridian hikers will have. The type of people that will be coming to my website is those who want to learn how to get started hiking in Florida, people who are looking for new places to hike, and those who are interested in Florida's State Forest Trailwalker Program. Part of the reason I am creating this site is while the state of Florida does have a webpage about their State Forest Trailwalker Program, it is rather barebones and doesn’t help people in getting them started in hiking the trails of Florida. Another reason for creating this site is that the design of the state’s site is rather dull and doesn’t invoke any feelings of adventure or nature. I have seen more lively websites for CIT professionals and will believe people will want to go interact more with a website that is at least somewhat pleasing to the eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main page will be an About or Summary page. It will talk about part of the history of the Florida trails and along with that about explain how Florida's State Forest Trailwalker Program works. This program, while a great idea is a bit obtuse to understand and use correctly. The basic idea of this program is that if you hike enough miles and trails in Florida the state will give you a badge so that you might remember your accomplishment. It is a way to encourage the use of the Florida trails. The front page of this website will explain how you, the hiker, can best use Florida's State Forest Trailwalker Program and the benefits of using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first child page will be a Tips and Advice for hiking the Florida trails. This page will not just only talk about general hiking tips, but also some more specific ones that pertain to some of the unique biomes of Florida. For example what to do if you see an alligator or a boar on the trail. Another one would be the times of the year when many trails are often muddy and difficult to use. This section would start off with the basic tips for beginners and then more advanced ones later in the page. It can also have a section at the bottom that would either link to an email address or give the email address for the website so that people can ask questions about hiking and get an answer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The second page will be a Trails of Florida List. Basically this list of some of the best trails to hike in the state of Florida. It would give a description and some advice for dealing with anything unique on that trail if needs be. Along with if that information would be a picture or two of the area and if that isn’t possible a picture of a similar-looking area. My plan is to highlight 5 or 6 trails that are excellent to hike in Florida. Later down in the page I would have a more simplified list that has far more trails and a small map of where they are located. The map location is key as not all sites that focus on trails have effective map locations. For example, the Florida state website is not the best with maps in its trail section. The idea, for now, is to have this additional list have about 30 – 40 trails that are separated into different regional groups, for example, southern Florida, the panhandle, central Florida, and so on.
